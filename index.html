        <div>
            <p>
                To keep things concise, balances are shown in a compact format:
                <strong>K</strong> = thousands, <strong>M</strong> = millions, <strong>B</strong> = billions.

                Balances are fetched when you open the Accounts view and may refresh periodically.
                If something looks out of date, try reopening the Accounts screen or ensuring you have a stable internet connection.

                never share it with anyone. For full details on data handling, please review our

                Your private key is handled locally on your device. We strongly recommend you keep an offline backup
                and never store it in plain text or share it through messaging apps or email.
