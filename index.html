  <!-- What the app does -->
  <details>
    <summary><h3>What does this app do?</h3></summary>
    <p>
      This app is a non-custodial wallet for managing your <strong>CS (Credits)</strong> accounts.
      You can create a new wallet, import an existing one using your private key, view balances,
      rename accounts, reorder them, and switch between accounts quickly.
    </p>
  </details>

  <!-- Getting started -->
  <details>
    <summary><h3>How do I create a new wallet?</h3></summary>
    <ol>
      <li>Open the app and go to <em>Accounts</em>.</li>
      <li>Tap the <strong>+</strong> button and choose <strong>Create New Wallet</strong>.</li>
      <li>Confirm creation and <strong>back up your private key immediately</strong>.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Important: Anyone with your private key can access your funds. Store it in a secure, offline place.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary><h3>How do I import an existing wallet?</h3></summary>
    <ol>
      <li>Open the app and go to <em>Accounts</em>.</li>
      <li>Tap the <strong>+</strong> button and select <strong>Add Existing Account</strong>.</li>
      <li>Paste your <strong>Base58-encoded private key</strong> and confirm.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      If you see an “Invalid Private Key” message, ensure the key is correctly copied, in Base58 format,
      and includes all characters. Try pasting again from your original backup.
    </p>
  </details>

  <!-- Accounts management -->
  <details>
    <summary><h3>Can I have multiple accounts?</h3></summary>
    <p>
      Yes. You can create or import multiple accounts and switch between them from the <em>Accounts</em> screen.
      Tap an account to make it your active account.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary><h3>How do I rename an account?</h3></summary>
    <ol>
      <li>Go to <em>Accounts</em> and tap <strong>Edit</strong>.</li>
      <li>Tap the <strong>pencil</strong> icon next to the account you want to rename.</li>
      <li>Enter a new name (up to 10 characters) and tap <strong>Save</strong>.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Names are stored locally on your device to help you organize your accounts.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary><h3>How do I reorder my accounts?</h3></summary>
    <ol>
      <li>Go to <em>Accounts</em> and tap <strong>Edit</strong>.</li>
      <li>Use the <strong>up/down arrows</strong> to move accounts.</li>
      <li>Tap <strong>Done</strong> to save your preferred order.</li>
    </ol>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary><h3>What do the numbers next to accounts mean?</h3></summary>
    <p>
      The number on the left (e.g., “1.”, “2.”) shows the position of the account in your custom order.
      The checkmark indicates the currently selected account.
    </p>
  </details>

  <!-- Balances and display -->
  <details>
    <summary><h3>Why do balances show K/M/B (e.g., 1.2K, 3.4M)?</h3></summary>
    <p>
      To keep things concise, balances are shown in a compact format:
      <strong>K</strong> = thousands, <strong>M</strong> = millions, <strong>B</strong> = billions.
      For very small balances, the app may show “&lt;0.0001”.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary><h3>How often are balances updated?</h3></summary>
    <p>
      Balances are fetched when you open the Accounts view and may refresh periodically.
      If something looks out of date, try reopening the Accounts screen or ensuring you have a stable internet connection.
    </p>
  </details>

  <!-- Security and privacy -->
  <details>
    <summary><h3>Is my data private?</h3></summary>
    <p>
      Your account names and ordering are stored locally on your device. Your private key is sensitive:
      never share it with anyone. For full details on data handling, please review our
      <a href="/privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary><h3>Where is my private key stored?</h3></summary>
    <p>
      Your private key is handled locally on your device. We strongly recommend you keep an offline backup
      and never store it in plain text or share it through messaging apps or email.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary><h3>What happens if I lose my device?</h3></summary>
    <p>
      If you lose access to your device, you can recover your wallet by installing the app on a new device
      and importing your private key. Without the private key, funds cannot be recovered.
    </p>
  </details>

  <!-- Troubleshooting -->
  <details>
    <summary><h3>I see “Invalid Private Key.” What should I do?</h3></summary>
    <ul>
      <li>Confirm the key is Base58-encoded and complete (no missing or extra characters).</li>
      <li>Paste directly from your original backup source.</li>
      <li>Try again and ensure there are no spaces or line breaks.</li>
    </ul>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary><h3>My balance looks wrong or isn’t updating. How can I fix it?</h3></summary>
    <ul>
      <li>Reopen the <em>Accounts</em> screen to trigger a refresh.</li>
      <li>Check your internet connection.</li>
      <li>Force-quit and relaunch the app.</li>
      <li>If the issue persists, contact support with your public key (never your private key).</li>
    </ul>
  </details>

  <!-- Costs and fees -->
  <details>
    <summary><h3>Are there any fees?</h3></summary>
    <p>
      Network fees may apply when sending transactions on the Credits network. These fees are determined by the network
      and are not collected by the app. Check your transaction details before confirming.
    </p>
  </details>

  <!-- General app management -->
  <details>
    <summary><h3>How do I switch accounts?</h3></summary>
    <p>
      Go to <em>Accounts</em> and tap the account you want to use. A checkmark will indicate the selected account.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary><h3>Can I remove an account from the app?</h3></summary>
    <p>
      You can remove an account by clearing it from your device (if the app provides a remove option) and then re-importing later if needed.
      Always ensure you have a secure backup of your private key before removing an account.
    </p>
  </details>

  <!-- Subscriptions / Purchases (edit as applicable) -->
  <details>
    <summary><h3>Does the app require a subscription?</h3></summary>
    <p>
      This app does not require a subscription to manage your wallet. If you purchased premium features through the App Store,
      you can manage or cancel them in your device’s <em>Settings &gt; Apple ID &gt; Subscriptions</em>.
