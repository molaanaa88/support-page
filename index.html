        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Can I have multiple accounts?</summary>

        </div>
      </details>

        <div>
          <p>To keep things concise, balances are shown in a compact format: <strong>K</strong> = thousands, <strong>M</strong> = millions, <strong>B</strong> = billions. For very small balances, the app may show “&lt;0.0001”.</p>
        </div>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>How often are balances updated?</summary>

      <details>
        <summary>What happens if I lose my device?</summary>
